Define pval and how it controls for FPR

Define qval and how it controls for FDR

P val is V/m0 because its the prop of false positives under the Ho, i.e. among null tests! Not among true alternative tests.

The pval not the qval is not the probability of being FP.

Comparison of pvals vs qvalues: less signif ones but less FPs when cutoff at qval

Explain how the the qvalue is computed from the pvalue and its interpretation from R code, is it equivalent to BH method?

p.adjust BH methd, how are pvals adjusted? is it the same as qith qvalue?

Let's generate a list of p-values from the standard normal distribution

```{r}
# p <- pnorm(c(rnorm(20), rnorm(5, mean = 5)), lower.tail = F)
# 
# ## Number of tests
# m <- length(p)
# 
# ## Index of test i (= number of tests declared significant i.e. with p<=pi)
# i <- m:1
# o <- order(p, decreasing = TRUE)
# ro <- order(o)
# 
#  qvals <- pi0s$pi0 * pmin(1, cummin(p[o] * m /i ))[ro]
```
